          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Going to High School</h2>
          <p class="lead">I was going into a school of over 200 kids in my grade, and I knew barley anyone. I didn't want to go to school, I would have done anything avoid going to my first day of freshman year. All that I wanted to do was avoid school, and lay in bed. I knew I couldn't, I knew I had two different options, 1. give up and just never go to school again, or 2. suck it up and put a smile on my face. I choose number two, considering I knew number one wasn't very likely to happen. First day of school came, and what did I do?? I walked into school with a smile on my face. Not only was I brave enough to walk through those daunting doors, but I also met friends that have lasted for a long time.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Opening up in Therapy</h2>
          <p class="lead">When I was struggling, the last thing that I wanted to do was open up to a person I never knew! I knew that I couldn't hndle my anxiety or my depression without some major help, but I also knew I did not want to tell someone I just met all my dark secrets. The thing was, therapuy is meant for you to open up, or else they can't help. Everytime that I would go to therapy, I would avoid talking about the real matters at hand. I felt that I would never open up, I felt like I was some freak in this world. After many, many, many therapy sessions, I forced myself to talk. I forced myself to tell my therapist about my constant anxiety attacks, and all my links to depresion that I had. I thought she would look at me funny, think I was a freak, or just drop me like everyone else. Guess what happened next? She didn't drop me! She helped me to control my thoughts, feelings, and aniety.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Pitching my Idea to my Peers</h2>
          <p class="lead">At my school, you are forced to take a half credit of a business course. This was no simple task though, this business course you had the ability to create a business. As the go getter that I am, I decided to be the CEO of my company, Summer Sweets. This journey of making a fake company came at no easy taks. We formed products, social media accouts for it, we took it internation, we created a mission and vision statement, and we also created a marketing campaign. At the end of this long semester, we had to pitch our business to our peers. This task was always a scary thing for me. I knew I was going to go up infront of my twenty plus peers, and a teacher I looked up, and I was suppose to provide an amanzing pitch. I was scared I'd be judged or made fun of if I stumbled on a word or forgot what I was saying. this task scared me. Of course, when the day finally came, I was so anxious and did not want to do it. When I got up to pitch, I took a big deep breathe, and I did it. I pitched my idea!</p>
